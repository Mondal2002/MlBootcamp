This is a machine learning model based on linear regression. Atfirst I have imported the dataset using pandas.Then used the colomn 'YearsExperience' as X and colomn 'Salary' as Y .I converted the X into a 2d array. Then splitted the data within two parts 20% for testing and the other part for training. I used Linear regression model from sklearn to train the model.
